## 📌 Project Overview

NeuroShift is a dual-mode cognitive reaction game designed to test and improve reflexes, focus, adaptability, and decision-making under time pressure.

The project consists of:

🔌 An ESP32 hardware simulation using Wokwi

Both versions follow the same core idea: react correctly to changing rules as fast as possible.
